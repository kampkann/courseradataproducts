# COURSERA - Developing Data Products - Shiny App project.

### Application requirement outline by coursera.

Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link

---------------------------------------------------


Select the state, year, crop and the plot area will be reactive to the selection.  In case of 
no data found the plot area will be blank. 

There are 4 types of the chart presented.

1. All India all crops :  
          This is summary of all India all crops over the period of 1998 and 2010
          this will remain same for all the selection.

2. Selected state, crop yearwise
          This is for a selected state and the selected crop the production on year wise.
          the change of selection in the year will not change this chart.

3. Top states for year and crop
          For the selected year and the crop, which states are the top n producers.
          change in the state selection will not change this chart.
          
4. For the state and Year all crops
          For the selected state and year all crops produced. 
          change in the crop will not change this chart.

===================================================

The server script does the subset and the aggregation depends on the selection creteria.

Millets variety are BAJRA, RAGI, SAMAI, VARAGU  and Sorgham is called JOWAR 

Over the period of years the millets production is reduced. and very small portion of the country is producing the crop.

Developing this app is a good starting point to look at how to develop ad present the data for public consumption.
